// should print global twice
// ok so before chapter 11 this prints "global" then "block", which is apparently incorrect.
// After chapter 11, it prints global twice which is correct. 

// flow goes like this
// first line calls declare() and define() "a", but since scopes stack is empty it does nothing
// block statement adds scope onto stack in resolver.java
// showA is defined
// print statement calls resolve on "a", we search all scopes
